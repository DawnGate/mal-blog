# First thing fist

The idea I got from the Nicholas Canete, [ecommerce-microservices](https://github.com/nicholas-gcc/nodejs-ecommerce-microservice)

Many thanks for Nicholas, but this the source not complete It take some hard time for me to understand and put the hand on improve it.

I has heard many people tell about microservices, so try it for new view.

Microservices:

- more time for develop, maintain, test for make sure done, docker and many way to make connection and transfer data
- easy for containerize, scale

The project re create the microservice with gateway for Proxy, auth, order and product container

Source code: [https://github.com/DawnGate/relearn/tree/miniapp/mini-app/microservices-backend](https://github.com/DawnGate/relearn/tree/miniapp/mini-app/microservices-backend)

ci source: [https://github.com/DawnGate/relearn/tree/ci/miniapp-micro-be/mini-app/microservices-backend](https://github.com/DawnGate/relearn/tree/ci/miniapp-micro-be/mini-app/microservices-backend)

# The technology

- Nodejs
- Docker
- test(mocha, chai)
- CI (github actions)
- express
- queue(pub/sub) -> rabbitmq
- mongodb

# The main features

- api gateway will forward request to containers
- auth -> store user information and authenticate request
- order -> store order information, publish order status to product
- product -> store product clientInformation, receive order and forward to order container through rabbitmq
- rabbitmq -> handle pub/sub message from order and product
- docker for containerlize instance
- github actions -> verify code and test

# Notes

- container structure:

  - config -> export constanst config and from enviroment
  - model -> describe database model
  - repository -> abstract adapter for handle interaction with model
  - services -> handle bussness logic when interact with repository to get information from db
  - controller -> handle request, response status and forward to services logic relative
  - middleware -> middleware for intercept request or authorization
  - router -> describe the routing for instance
  - app.js -> container App class, specific construct to start, stop, and connect with other third party library
  - utils -> abstract handle connection with other library
  - .env -> enviroment
  - index.js -> where file start to run with npm start

- this project give ideas, not fully implement so many bug can occur during time when I get and interact with origin source
- github actions may need config enviroment secrets, please check readme file fore more instructions

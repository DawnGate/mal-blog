# First thing first

One day, I want to connect my current nextjs project with postgres database. I don't want install multiple things with my local 16gb ram dell laptop. :V

I come to idea: Using docker and everything is single container, postgres container connected with pgadmin container

But not need to wait, I quickly saw a problem: pgadmin can't connect postgres, finding all internet and I still stuck with it. And luckily after 6 hours(2 hours in coffee for chilling) I've found the way to get out of: "How connect postgres with pgadmin problem in password authenticate fail for user..."

The problem occur because: "I've ALREADY install POSTGRESQL in locally - port 5432 has occupy"

# How to solve

- Make sure you install docker and already have 2 image: [https://hub.docker.com/\_/postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres) and [https://hub.docker.com/r/dpage/pgadmin4](https://hub.docker.com/r/dpage/pgadmin4)
- Currently i'm using postgres: alpine3.19 and dpage/pgadmin4:latest(Mar 7, 2024 at 6:58 pm)

## SOLUTION 1: Uninstall your local postgres

- setup postgres, the default setup from [https://hub.docker.com/\_/postgres](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres). After remove local postgres, you can using port 5432:5432, POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword

## SOLUTION 2: Change host port to other port

- Setup your postgres container with other port, with me in this example I using port 5427:5432

## SOLUTION 3: Connect postgres with docker ip (For fun)

- I found a real ip of postgres in docker network, and using it for connect with pgadmin :V

# Conclusion

What you host on docker, it in a docker big container(
other container,
other container,
other container
)

It create environment inner of it docker, so connect each other should using it our ip and port.

Another thing is, make sure check the port :V in your current laptop. docker can't override or tell you this port has occupy

Some time you will take more time to think and setup. :D, Please don't like me. Thank you.

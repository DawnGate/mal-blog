# First thing first

Thank you for Navdeep and his project [digitic](https://github.com/navdeep1676/digitic-backend)

This is a project for building backend api for the ecommerce platform.

Link of the completed project: https://github.com/DawnGate/relearn/tree/miniapp/mini-app/ecommerce-backend

# The technology

- Mongodb with mongoose
- image handle with multer, and resize with sharp
- Authenticate with jsonWebToken(jwt) and bcrypt
- handling runing wiht nodemon
- send mail with google mail and nodemail
- handle async error with express-async-handler
- express for backend web application

# The main features

- Authenticate

# Notes

I choose this repository in the youtube because the view and reviews. But like tiktok, sometime it get wrong.

The limited of resource about backend. I know the occur of nextjs change many thing. You can only work in nextjs project with some ORM library, you'll have application can work and happy with it.

But this come with some problems about maintainable, performance, upgrade and grow. And these are reason why many app still using backend along with frontend.

What I got?

- First, this repo give me some concepts and ideas about how backend work, and the synchronization
- Second, some big view for the ecommerce site work
- And Last, is how contruct a backend project with nodejs

<br />

What I think this repo should?

- The mongoose is not comming with good docs, so manything the origin video educate not good instruction and the code like not update and correct with the video.
- Some problem with the security, many bugs will occur if you bring it to a live product
- And it is a mono repo, like an old technique, the current trend is microservices

<br />
What I will learn in another miniapp - Logging and tracking, analytics example for deploy - Using some tool for performance
tracking - How implement server and depoy it - Handle 1000 CCU (:V)

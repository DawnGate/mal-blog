# First thing first

The idea I see from the Atonio, [trello-clone](https://github.com/AntonioErdeljac/next13-trello)

This project same with the github project, I try to understand the code and reimplement to something can work.

It make me feel that I can catch up with the trend and know more about some useful library

# The technology

- Nextjs (14)
- Node (18)
- Shadcn-ui
- Clerk (authenticate and authorize)
- Prisma (ORM with mongodb)
- Splash (for image)
- Stripe (for subscription)

# The main features

- Landing page
- Authenticate (Login, Sign Up, Authorize)
- Profile, Organization
- Board, List, Card
- Drag and drop
- Subscription

# Notes

With nextjs the idea with actions for form, and useFormState, and useFormStatus from react 18
bring a new way to handle action form server and client. From my view, it bring
more actions to server

Sometime nextjs bring not good Ux, the Idea for nextjs is bring good seo and action quickly for user,
but with a minimal app sometime it bring lagging.

Structure of code, the app with construct from layout, page, loading, skeleton
structure from project:

- library, third party will go into folder "lib"
- components will seperates with shared and private
- state management will need more (global state - zustand for modal, dialog, server state management - react-query for client component need refresh data from server )
- handle api with route.js => sometime very useful
- tailwind with radix-ui, shadcn for quickly setup and start

And many more to learn, I will update later ðŸ˜‡

# Somethings I like

- After translate from Chinese to English, I like how the project look, the UI/UX is so good,
  smooth and easy for using as a ecommerce app
- The structure, when I came with this project, I only think about redux, but after doing a little of stuff
  of settings, special with typescript. I can see the beautiful of structure of this app. Every components will in one
  file of index.ts, where you can easily to access and figure where it is. The structure forcus on overral structure, where
  store with slices and services, Modal, util, components - all components ==. This structure easy using for middle to small size project.
- Every file only contain < 200 lines of code, easy to read and code splitting

# Somethings I don't like

- This project setting with js, so many bug can occur
- Not include test for frontend
- Not follow best practice with nextjs, mongoose or redux

# Somethings I done

- setup with typescript
- setup code consistency conventional
- Done Login/SignUp, and layout for client ( header, footer)
- I will comeback later to completed it, but current it take me 10 days, out of 7 days per project so I decided to stop it

# Introduce

When I start this projects, I had come with idea how quickly ship to production. I chose nextjs as framework, js for not type safe :V and markdown for the first blog.

But no long time for problem occur. My blog content with no css. And my brain said: "Yup. My second blog will how I make my blog more colors".

# what is MDX?

MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content. This makes writing long-form content with components a blast.

See more in [mdx](https://mdxjs.com/)

For me, it mean: from a simple **Readme.md** normal, now you can using both **Readme.md** and **Readme.jsx** in same file, and this file name **Readme.mdx** ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£.

# The old code

Let look back, this is a old code. I'm using .md file like this.

```js
# lib/api.js
import fs from 'fs'
import { join } from 'path'
import matter from 'gray-matter'

const blogDirectory = join(process.cwd(), '_blog')

const getBlogSlugs = () => {
  return fs.readdirSync(blogDirectory)
}

export const getBlogBySlug = (slug, fields) => {
  const realSlug = slug.replace(/.md$/, '')
  const fullPath = join(blogDirectory, `${realSlug}.md`)
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf-8')
  const { data, content } = matter(fileContents)
}
```

I'm using gray-matter to get metadata and content separate. After that, using remark-html to parse string to html.
And pass the html to div to can render. Like example below.

```js
# lib/markdownToHTML.js
import { remark } from 'remark'
import html from 'remark-html'

const markdownToHtml = async (markdown) => {
  const result = await remark().use(html).process(markdown)
  return result.toString()
}

export default markdownToHtml
```

```jsx
# blog/[slug].js

const Blog = ({ blog }) => {
  return (
    <PageLayout title={blog.title}>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: blog.content }} />
    </PageLayout>
  )
}
```

Other example in [next/blog-starter](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/blog-starter). The example from **Nextjs**, with more detail for a blog project.

But you see, with this it will not enough. When style for md file is difficult. I found a library [next-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote).
and a example from next repository [next/with-mdx-remote](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mdx-remote).

# Using next-mdx-remote

First of all, install step.

```bash
yarn add next-mdx-remote
```

Edit your lib/api.js. Now import _serialize_ to can process your markdown. The config is a bit different then default because I use rehypePlugins to high light code and frontmatter to read meta data.

```js
# lib/api.js

import fs from 'fs'
import { join } from 'path'
import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize'

import rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight'

const blogDirectory = join(process.cwd(), '_blog')

const getBlogSlugs = () => {
  return fs.readdirSync(blogDirectory)
}

export const getBlogBySlug = (slug = '') => {
  const realSlug = slug.replace(/\.mdx$/, '')
  const fullPath = join(blogDirectory, `${realSlug}.mdx`)
  const fileContents = fs.readFileSync(fullPath, 'utf-8')
  const mdxSource = serialize(fileContents, {
    parseFrontmatter: true,
    mdxOptions: {
      remarkPlugins: [],
      rehypePlugins: [rehypeHighlight],
      format: 'mdx',
    },
  })

  return mdxSource
}
```

After have _mdxSource_, now pass it as props in _MDXRemote_ component, it provide from _next-mdx-remote_

```jsx
# /post/[blog].js
import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote'

const Blog = ({ blogMdxSource }) => {
  return (
    <PageLayout title={blogMdxSource.frontmatter.title}>
      <MDXRemote components={mdxComponents} {...blogMdxSource} />
    </PageLayout>
  )
}
```

If you consider what is components?, and components is list of override components you have config.
The code below is my custom components override for mdx components.

```jsx
import MLink from './Link'
import MCodeBlock from './MCodeBlock'
import MHeading from './MHeading'
import MTypography from './MTypography'

const mdxComponents = {
  p: MTypography,
  h1: MHeading,
  a: MLink,
  code: MCodeBlock,
}

export default mdxComponents
```

Yeah, you all done.

# Conclusion

I think this make more possible when using with mdx. I will update more If possible.

With list of plugins of mdx. It will big advances for try.
